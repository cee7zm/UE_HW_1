Usability Engineering Class Homework 1
Author: cee7zm
University: UVA

"In this first assignment, you'll have the role of a programmer, who has been hired by the mysterious anti-UX forces of Dr. Antiusabilious to create an interface that tortures people in completing their task(s). Using your evolving knowledge of usability guidelines taught in class, design and develop a website that breaks as many guidelines as possible to provide the most frustrating experience possible! Your website should have a clear goal (accomplishment of task or tasks), which should be achieved in the most inefficient, ineffective, hard to learn, unsatisfactory way possible, eventually making the system totally useless!

WARNING: You need to suspend whatever we learned and you know about "ethical design." The goal justifies the means here, and the goal is to meet the learning objectives of this assignment (and this class). The users--in this case the instructor, TAs, and your classmates--will survive this design!"
